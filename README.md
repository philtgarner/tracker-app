# tracker-app
An app to upload your location at a given interval

##A companion app
This is an Android app designed to interact with the REST interface that can be found [here](https://github.com/philtgarner/tracker). You *must* have access to a server running the REST interface for this app to work.

##Testing
The app has only been tested by me on a Nexus 5 running Android Lollipop, I have limited access to other devices so I'm relying on you guys to point out any device specific bugs.

##Privacy
When set up correctly this app will send  your location to a server of your choice. It will continue to do this until you tell it to stop, as a result you may publically broadcast the location of your home, as an added privacy measure add your home location in the settings and the app will stop broadcasting within a given radius of your home.

##Floating Action Button (FAB)
This app makes use of the rather brilliant [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/makovkastar/FloatingActionButton) library by [Melnykov Oleksandr](https://github.com/makovkastar). Thank you!

##Download
The app is still in its early days so hasn't yet been released on Google Play but it will be fairly soon.
